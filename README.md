WordPress 4.2 Stored XSS

Current versions of WordPress are vulnerable to a stored XSS. An unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript in WordPress comments. The script is triggered when the comment is viewed.

If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server via the plugin and theme editors.

Alternatively the attacker could change the administratorâ€™s password, create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently logged-in administrator can do on the target system.
